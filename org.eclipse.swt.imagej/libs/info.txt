If you want to start ImageJ as a desktop application you have to add the SWT and JFace libraries here (preferred)
and to the Java runtime classpath!

At the moment the following libs are required
which can, e.g., be copied from an Eclipse IDE distribution (plugins directory):

org.eclipse.core.commands
org.eclipse.core.runtime
org.eclipse.equinox.common
org.eclipse.jface
org.eclipse.jface.text
org.eclipse.osgi
org.eclipse.swt
org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.aarch64 (the OS dependent swt natives - change for your OS!)
org.eclipse.text
